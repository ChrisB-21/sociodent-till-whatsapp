# WhatsApp Integration Setup Guide

## ✅ Status: INTEGRATED

WhatsApp messaging has been successfully integrated into your SocioDent registration flow!

## 🎯 What happens now?

When users register (both patients and doctors), they will automatically receive a WhatsApp welcome message:

**Message:** "Hi [Name], welcome to SocioDent! Your registration was successful."

## 📱 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Twilio Credentials
1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**
3. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
   VITE_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   ```

### 2. WhatsApp Number Setup

#### Option A: Production (Your Business Number)
- **Sender:** +918825786991 (Your WhatsApp business account)
- **Requirements:** Business verification with Twilio
- **Status:** Ready to use once credentials are added

#### Option B: Testing (Twilio Sandbox)
- **Sender:** +14155238886 (Twilio Sandbox)
- **Requirements:** Recipients must join sandbox first
- **How to join:** Send "join <sandbox_code>" to +14155238886

## 📞 Phone Number Formats Supported

The service automatically handles various Indian phone number formats:
- `8825786991` → `whatsapp:+918825786991`
- `+918825786991` → `whatsapp:+918825786991`
- `08825786991` → `whatsapp:+918825786991` (removes leading 0)
- `91 8825786991` → `whatsapp:+918825786991`

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User completes registration form
2. Account is created in Firebase Auth
3. User data is saved to database
4. **NEW:** WhatsApp welcome message is sent automatically
5. Registration success message is shown

## 🔐 Security

- Environment variables are used for sensitive credentials
- Error handling prevents registration failure if WhatsApp fails
- No phone numbers or credentials are logged in production

## 📊 Monitoring

Check browser console for WhatsApp message status:
- ✅ Success: "WhatsApp message sent successfully! Message SID: xxx"
- ❌ Error: "Failed to send WhatsApp message: [error details]"

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Your users will now receive WhatsApp welcome messages automatically upon registration. Just add your Twilio credentials to the `.env` file and you're all set!
