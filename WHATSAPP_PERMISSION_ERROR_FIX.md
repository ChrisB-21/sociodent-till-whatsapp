## üöÄ Quick Fixes to Try First

### Option 1: Use System Templates
Try using pre-approved system templates like `hello_world`:

```javascript
// Test with basic hello_world template (usually pre-approved)
const result = await WhatsAppWelcomeService.sendSimpleWelcome('your_phone', 'Test User');
```

### Option 2: Verify Phone Number Access
Check if your phone number can receive test messages:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/753038067883264/messages" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "to": "917042469530",
  "type": "template",
  "template": {
    "name": "hello_world",
    "language": {
      "code": "en_US"
    }
  }
}'
```

### Option 3: Check Current Status
1. Log into [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.whatsapp.com/)
2. Check "Overview" for any alerts or warnings
3. Verify all setup steps are complete

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Mode Setup

For testing, you can:

1. **Add Test Phone Numbers**:
   - In your app settings, add test phone numbers

   - Limited to test numbers only
